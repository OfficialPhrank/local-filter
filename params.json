This is a map representation of Montreal's STM subway/metro transit system.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\n-------------\r\nThis project is developed nearly entirely using vanilla javascript, but does utilize both:\r\n\r\n - KnockoutJS\r\n - jQuery\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nHow-To\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n 1. Download the git repository from \r\n http://github.com/officialphrank\r\n 2. Unzip the files locally.\r\n 3. Run the index.html\r\n 4. The map takes approximately 6s to fully load, you'll need to wait until all markers are placed on the map. (You will notice this sets of pins drop on the map, as well as 3 groups of names populating the list on the left-hand side of the app)\r\n 5. Once the map and list are populated, you can click on any list item to filter and single it out. You may also type in the filter box the text for any station you'd like to search for.\r\n 6. Clicking on any map marker or list item will filter and display images of that particular station. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Notes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis project is still a work-in-progress. As it stands, it is fully functional, save for a few elements that need to be worked on.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nJohn, Ben, Alex, Abigail, Sarah.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
